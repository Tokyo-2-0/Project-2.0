    <p2>Metalhead Community is an online magazine dedicated to covering the music and culture of the Metal underground. It launched on June 8, 2016, on social media and grew quickly into a brand new platform that debuted January 12, 2017. Our mission is to support and promote the emerging bands and artists who are keeping Metal alive and pushing it forward.
        With years of experience on both sides of the industry (as an artist and publisher/promoter), Metalhead Community has always been special with its mission of highlighting pure talents from all over the world over mainstream music. We have collaborated with thousands of bands, labels, pr agents, blogs, and brands over the years, and built our community with the trust, respect and the solid feedback we’ve received in return.
        We are very proud of our brand with everything we have developed within these years. Metalhead Community is one of the most-respected independent tastemakers of today’s music industry with more than 100.000 followers and 1.5 million reach on Social Media.
